expectations when in fact, I was.</p><p>When telling myself to not have a certain expectation against someone,
I did usually make sure to control my behaviour towards them. If I
anticipated that I shouldn&rsquo;t have the expectation of an event taking
place, I made sure not to make the responsible person feel
negatively about the non-event. I figured that not holding the
expectation would mean that I may not act upset or angry towards them.</p><p>The mistake I made was to think about the latter as sufficient condition to claim to
&rsquo;not have had the expectation&rsquo; instead of regarding it as simply one of several
implications.</p><p>Not having an expectation against someone means both not <em>acting</em>
negatively towards that person as well as not thinking or feeling negatively
<em>inside</em>, independently of the behaviour, i.e. act, displayed towards others.</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><ul class=page-footer-menu></ul><div class=copyright><p>&copy; 2022
