In the following I will make some simple observations based on this data. The data goes back to 2016 and comprises timestamps and running distances in km.</p><p>In bad storytelling manner let&rsquo;s start with the most graspable and interesting statistic first: average and overall distance across years. I had never computed those before and had basically no intuition on it at all. I couldn&rsquo;t have said whether I had been running more or less than last year. Turns out there was a substantial difference.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th style=text-align:right>2016</th><th style=text-align:right>2017</th><th style=text-align:right>2018</th><th style=text-align:right>2019</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>avg distance</td><td style=text-align:right>4.79</td><td style=text-align:right>5.62</td><td style=text-align:right>5.61</td><td style=text-align:right>9.08</td></tr><tr><td>distance</td><td style=text-align:right>134</td><td style=text-align:right>354</td><td style=text-align:right>430</td><td style=text-align:right>962</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Given this lack of intuition I find it rather surprising to see the yearly distance increase more than twofold. I guess I won&rsquo;t complain. :) The increased average distance made me wonder: Did I only leave out shorter runs or did I actually run &rsquo;longer runs&rsquo;? As an, arguably weak, proxy I looked into the 20 longest runs I had every run and investigated which year they belonged to. Turns out practically all of them stem from 2019.</p><p><img src=/imgs/top_runs.png alt="20 longest runs">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>I figure this expresses that the average distance did not only increase through leaving out shorter runs.</p><p>Moreover, I wondered whether there were periodic phenomena on a monthly scale. Despite usually considering myself more or less indifferent to weather conditions, the following plot shows peaks in the summer months for 2017 and 2018. 2019 paints a less clear picture. Maybe the summer peaks and the summer are not causally related but only correlated by say a change of lifestyle? Both summers of 2017 and 2018 did not have me attend and work for lectures but rather intern and do exam prep.</p><p><img src=/imgs/monthly_sums.png alt="monthly sums">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>Overall, the average run distance does not seem to be vastly influenced by seasonal/periodic circumstances. I tell myself that this vaguely and qualitatively confirms my wishful thinking of me not being a fair weather runner. :)</p><p><img src=/imgs/monthly_means.png alt="monthly means">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>Within 2019, I looked into weekly stats. It turns out that I averaged at 2.04 runs per week and 18.5 km per week. Following are histograms of the number of weekly runs and weekly distances with said means as vertical lines.</p><p><img src=/imgs/weekly_n_runs.png alt="weekly number of runs">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p><img src=/imgs/weekly_cumulative_histogram.png alt="weekly distance histogram">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>While quite a few weeks came with fairly little mileage, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied to see that there were only 5 weeks without running despite quite several of traveling.</p><p>Lastly, I wondered: Are greater weekly distances more associated with how often I pulled myself together to go for a run or more associated by for how long I hung in runs? For that purpose, restricting myself to linear effects, I computed the Pearson coefficients between said metrics.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th style=text-align:right>Pearson coefficient</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>weekly distance</td><td>weekly average distance</td><td style=text-align:right>.65</td></tr><tr><td>weekly distance</td><td>weekly number of runs</td><td style=text-align:right>.88</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While there is no simple answer to the brought-up question, this might be an interesting observation that is vaguely related.</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><ul class=page-footer-menu></ul><div class=copyright><p>&copy; 2022
