I kept thinking about cellular automata but reckoned that they often created outcomes that looked:</p><ul><li>overly structured in general</li><li>busy, hard and cold in detail.</li></ul><p>I figured that the latter could maybe be tackled by applying lots of smoothing, both on input and output image. The former seemed a bit harder to tackle as I&rsquo;d need explicit rules/probabilities for something that would</p><ul><li>not be nothing</li><li>not look overly structured</li></ul><p>How to get ahold of such rules?</p><h2 id=approach>Approach</h2><p>I came up with the idea of constructing rules based on neighboring colors. Given a colored central pixel, its neighboring pixels would be colored depending on the central pixel. The color of the neighbors could be determined by randomness: independently draw a color for each neighbor from a probability distribution over colors conditioning on the color of the central pixel.</p><p><img src=/imgs/neighbors.png alt="Neighboring pixels">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>In this particular visualization one would need to look up the distribution conditioning on the own color being violet. Each arrow represents an independent draw from that distribution.</p><p>Yet, such a conditional distribution over colors needs to be defined. I didn&rsquo;t feel sufficiently inspired to hard-code one myself. Hence the need to <em>learn</em> a conditional probability table of the sort: \(\Pr[color_{neighbor}| color_{own}]\). This could be inferred from a conditional histogram of an actual image.</p><p>Assuming the existence of only three colors, such tables could look the following way:</p><table><thead><tr><th>\(color_{neighbor}\)</th><th>\(\Pr[color_{neighbor}| color_{own} = violet]\)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>white</td><td>.15</td></tr><tr><td>violet</td><td>.40</td></tr><tr><td>rose</td><td>.45</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>\(color_{neighbor}\)</th><th>\(\Pr[color_{neighbor}| color_{own} = white]\)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>white</td><td>.20</td></tr><tr><td>violet</td><td>.30</td></tr><tr><td>rose</td><td>.50</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>\(color_{neighbor}\)</th><th>\(\Pr[color_{neighbor}| color_{own} = rose]\)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>violet</td><td>.18</td></tr><tr><td>rose</td><td>.40</td></tr><tr><td>white</td><td>.42</td></tr></tbody></table><p>What histogram to use? The natural answer for an image processing project had to be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna>Lena</a>.</p><p>Given the nature of the &rsquo;neighboring&rsquo; relationship and the fact that</p><ul><li>the option space for &lsquo;own colors&rsquo; and &rsquo;neighboring colors&rsquo; are identical,</li><li>the neighboring color is only dependent on the original color cell, and no further context,</li></ul><p>this relationship is naturally represented by a fully connected <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain>Markov chain</a>.</p><p><img src=/imgs/mc.png alt="Markov chain">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>Put explicitly, the approach corresponds to the following:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>1. Smoothen input image
2. Learn conditional probabilities via conditional histogram on input image
3. Create a blank output image of arbitrary resolution
4. Pick a random pixel and color it according to some arbitrary distribution
   over the set of possible colors
5. Start a breadth-first exploration and color every neighbor by sampling
   according to the conditional probability table of the current color
6. Smoothen output image
</code></pre><p>Note that the 5th step corresponds to starting a (respectively, many) random walk(s) on the Markov chain for every neighbor.</p><p>Also note that the 5th step is not parallelizable by default as it requires some mutual exclusivity on writes. Hence this could take a while for high resolution pictures without further concurrency enhancements.</p><p>I stumbled upon <a href=https://github.com/JonnoFTW/markov-img-gen>Jonathan Mackenzie&rsquo;s github repo</a>, which provided all of the necessary functionality.</p><h2 id=outcome>Outcome</h2><p><img src=/imgs/deconstructed_lena.png alt="Deconstructed Lena">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>512x512 pixels</p><p><img src=/imgs/hung_lena.png alt="Hung Lena">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>4000x5000 pixels, printed on roughly 33x42 cm</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><ul class=page-footer-menu></ul><div class=copyright><p>&copy; 2022
