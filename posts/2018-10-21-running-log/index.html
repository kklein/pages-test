I figured most of what they provided was only interesting in short-term for two reasons.</p><p>On the one hand, I changed phones and tracking apps from time to time, which would sometimes lead to a reset of information. Also, some tracking apps were discontinued. You could say they introduced technical debt that I often was not willing or able to carry on.</p><p>On the other hand, the kind of information they provided was only relevant in the short term. I would care about pace comparisons on the same track within the scope of a month, about calories in the scope of a day or week, but not months and years.</p><p>I am aware that this is an arbitrary situation that might be very different for other people.</p><p>I was looking for a long-term logging of information that seemed relevant in the long-term: Frequencies of exercise and running distances.</p><h2 id=requirements>Requirements</h2><ul><li>Data stored in a central place.</li><li>That place very likely to persist over the course <em>years</em>.</li><li>Able to express information about when I exercised, and what distance I ran if said exercise was running.</li><li>Convenient to read and write information on both mobile and browser.</li><li>Able to portray developments over time.</li></ul><h2 id=solution>Solution</h2><p>Google Calendar offered many advantages that fit the situation:</p><ul><li>I was already using it for other timetelling purposes.</li><li>I had reason to assume it was not going away any time soon.</li><li>Mature and convenient interfaces: API, mobile app, web app.</li></ul><p>Hence I decided to log all sports activities in my private calendar with a specific color code. Also, I named the entries accordingly, e.g. &lsquo;Running&rsquo;. Information about distances was taken care of by populating the event description with an indication, e.g. &lsquo;9.6 km&rsquo;.</p><p><img src=/imgs/gcal_event.png alt="gcal event">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>I wrote a simple script to query the calendar events from Google&rsquo;s API and opted to visualize the data by aggregating per week distances and plotting weeks against distances within a certain time interval.</p><p><img src=/imgs/gcal_distances.png alt="resulting plot">{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}</p><p>There still is a lot of room for more elaborate analysis both in terms of metrics and visualizations.</p><h2 id=comments>Comments</h2><ul><li>Note that using this manual logging approach served as a substitution to logging apps for me, but can very well be considered complementary to them.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve been using this script for quite a while and I find it quite interesting to look into trends of my activities. I have been logging events accordingly for 2-3 years.</li><li>It was fun to use data about myself <em>myself</em> and I&rsquo;d encourage you to play around with the calendar API as well, given that you have some kind of consistency in logging events.</li></ul><p>You can find the code <a href=https://github.com/kklein/gcal-analysis>here</a>, it is supposed to be easy to execute and understand.</p><h2 id=update-190819-interactive-d3-visualization-in-browser>Update 19/08/19: Interactive d3 visualization in browser</h2><p>After some years of telling myself to work with d3 again, I finally used this little project to do so. I used the exact same data and fed them to an interactive visualization. More concretely, running distances, both on a daily and weekly basis, are plotted against dates. The advantages of the <em>interactive</em> visualizations are:</p><ul><li>Tooltip indicating exact distance when hovering over individual datapoint.</li><li>X-axis (dates) is zoomable by scrolling anywhere over the visualization.</li><li>X-axis (dates) is pannable once zoomed in.</li></ul><p>You can easily give the <a href=http://kevinkle.in/gcal_vis/index.html>live demo</a> a try, courtesy of my data. ;)</p><p>The <a href=https://github.com/kklein/gcal-analysis>repository</a> now contains both approaches.</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><ul class=page-footer-menu></ul><div class=copyright><p>&copy; 2022
