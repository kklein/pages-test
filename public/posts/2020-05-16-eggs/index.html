<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>8 eggs</li>
<li>1 cup of white balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1/2 cup of liquid from tinned beets</li>
<li>2 tbsp cardamon pods</li>
<li>2 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
<li>2 tbsp coriander seeds</li>
<li>2 tbsp pepper corns</li>
<li>1 tbsp fennel seeds</li>
<li>1 tbsp mustard seeds</li>
<li>a few cloves</li>
<li>a few bay leaves</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>2 tbsp curry powder</li>
<li>2 tbsp turmeric</li>
<li>2 tbsp sweet paprika powder</li>
<li>2 tbsp salt</li>
<li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<p>Boil the eggs as little as possible while making sure they&rsquo;re actually boiled. If you found just the right spot, make
sure to put them into ice water as to prevent them continuing to cook themselves.</p>
<p>In the meantime toast your whole spices in a dry pan on medium heat until your kitchen smells like a market in a
far-flung exotic place. Eventually add the beet juice and ground spices to combine everything well. In particular,
make sure the sure is well disolved. Let cool for a bit.</p>
<p>Add your spice mixture and the vinegar into your mason jar.</p>
<p>Peel your hard-boiled eggs and add them, too.</p>

<p>I let them pickle for roughly 7-10 days. They looked really cool - orange on the outside and pink on the inside.
They ended up being fairly acidic, partly overshadowing the taste of spices. I think it be cool if one could spare
some of the vinegar, although I&rsquo;m not sure what this would imply for their shelf life.</p>
