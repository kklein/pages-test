This has mostly been for the sheer sake of journaling. In other words: once written, never to be read.
At the same time I would like to use information about my past when making decisions for the future. When simply winging this inference on empirical data, I&rsquo;m always worried that some warping could have altered my recollection of these experiences (in other words: a noisy communication channel) and thereby bias my inference mechanism unjustly.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2022-02-27-org_journal/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2022-02-18-goals/>Goals Are Arbitrary</a></h1><time>Feb 26, 2022</time><br><div class=description>I have the pleasure of having impressive friends who have completed and continue to complete spectacular athletic feats. Some crossed the alps with a single speed steel tandem bike. Some run 10k in 35&rsquo;. Some run half-marathons with more than 2000m of elevation literally called inferno. And then, of course, there is the camp of people who go about this whole ironman business.

One revolved around depth-first search in trees, one around linear programming. This time I tried my luck with a more adventurous, data-driven approach: Reinforcement Learning.

Ingredients Puff pastry Figs (preferably fresh ones; if not, dried ones are ok, too) Ricotta Rocket Method Cut some parts of the puff pastry. I figure both rectangles and squares should work. While all sizes &lsquo;go&rsquo;, I think that in principle one wants to use as little dough per fixed filling size as possible.

Different algorithms ought to still lead to the same solution, since a correct Sudoku puzzle comes with a unique solution. In this post we&rsquo;ll rely on optimization&rsquo;s poster child: Linear programming.
Idea A linear program, subsequently referred to as LP, comes with three central building blocks:
An objective function Typically many variables, each, a priori, non-integer numbers Linear constraints on the variables Since, thanks to our assumption of a well-posed puzzle we know that:&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2021-03-14-sudoku_lp/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"></span><span class="page-item page-next"><a href=/pages-test/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>Next →</span></a></span></ul></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2022 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
