I was fairly taken by the idea of programming with randomization to create sort-of-art. I kept thinking about cellular automata but reckoned that they often created outcomes that looked:
overly structured in general busy, hard and cold in detail. I figured that the latter could maybe be tackled by applying lots of smoothing, both on input and output image.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2019-09-27-lena/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2019-09-23-breaking_pills/>Breaking Pills: An Intuition</a></h1><time>Sep 23, 2019</time><br><div class=description>Motivation Recently, Mark Dominus&rsquo; post on breaking pills appeared on Hacker News. I was surprised to see the author not provide a closed-form and wanted to extend on some of the comments indicating a relation to the harmonic numbers.
Problem Formulation Starting off with a bowl of \(n\) whole pills, you draw from the bowl uniformly at random according to the following mechanism: if the drawn pill is whole, you put back one half of it; if the drawn pill is half, you don&rsquo;t put back anything.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2019-09-23-breaking_pills/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2019-08-10-challenge/>Challenge People</a></h1><time>Aug 14, 2019</time><br><div class=description>Abstract This post introduces an arbitrary topic on which I changed my mind, mostly through own reflection. I intend to exemplify my pet theory: I could have changed opinion and landed in a more desirable situation much faster if my original position had been challenged more by my social environment.
An exemplary change of opinion: Messaging Previous position I vividly remember claiming that messaging people one doesn&rsquo;t talk to on a regular basis was pointless, as long as there wasn&rsquo;t a very specific topic to discuss, which required a lot of groundwork to be laid out already.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2019-08-10-challenge/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2019-08-10-noodles/>Korean Noodle Salad</a></h1><time>Aug 10, 2019</time><br><div class=description>This is a recipe for a Korean noodle salad. Its raw and at most lukewarm ingredients as well as the the coriander-acidity pairing make it feel light and fresh despite the rich nature of the peanut butter and sesame oil. I can recommend it as a main course on summer evenings.

Note that only students with certain coursework or projects are granted access. I have spent and lost a fair amount of time due to poor Google results and will describe a setup for a simple workflow.
Connection In order to ssh to the server, you first need to connect to ETH&rsquo;s VPN.

In the following I will try to describe a naive algorithm relying on a randomized argument. What I find particularly remarkable is that it can easily parry the critique I am so often encountered with when cherishing randomized algorithms: it can trivially be turned deterministic.

Why Whether you&rsquo;re using sklearn transformations already or implementing data wrangling from scratch, there are interesting aspects to squeezing those into an sklearn pipeline. Most notably, this will:
Allow for the usage of sklearn&rsquo;s cross validation. Allow for the usage of sklearn&rsquo;s grid search. Lower the barrier to include sklearn transformations, such as TfidfVectorizer, in the future. It would be possible to do all such processing without a pipeline object: once on the whole dataset.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2019-01-10-sklearn-pipelines/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2018-10-21-running-log/>Running Log</a></h1><time>Oct 28, 2018</time><br><div class=description>Problem Sports tracking apps offer lots of interesting functionalities regarding the logging of activities. I figured most of what they provided was only interesting in short-term for two reasons.
On the one hand, I changed phones and tracking apps from time to time, which would sometimes lead to a reset of information. Also, some tracking apps were discontinued. You could say they introduced technical debt that I often was not willing or able to carry on.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2018-10-21-running-log/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2018-10-05-advice/>On Advice</a></h1><time>Oct 5, 2018</time><br><div class=description>Sometimes concrete advice is fairly context-insensitive: Dale Carnegie suggests to always greet people in the fashion of a dog. Such advice might be useful at times, yet I believe that the upper bound of created value by such concrete yet context-insensitive advice is low.
My impression is that most valuable decisions are context-sensitive by nature, i.e. relying on a lot of individual, complex information. The overwhelming complexity and volume of context can be mistakenly overlooked when formulating advice.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2018-10-05-advice/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2018-09-09-apologies/>On Apologies: A Poor Man's Taxonomy</a></h1><time>Sep 9, 2018</time><br><div class=description>I have gotten confused and frustrated over apologies from time to time. They have been a consistent source of miscommunication. I figured that it isn&rsquo;t clear to me what an apology means in the general case. Hence I tried to distinguish possible meanings in more concrete cases.
I &lsquo;regret&rsquo; my action and given the hypothetical chance to undo it, I would.
