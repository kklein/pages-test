					<time>May 10, 2020</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						There&rsquo;s just something great about caramelized chicory. While I&rsquo;ve often got there by covering it in honey and balsamic vinegar, I was inclined to look for a similar effect with actual grapes. In additional to the lovely interplay of bitterness and sweetness, there is something light about the acidity of the grapes.
I figured that caramelized onions would only enhance this interplay without distracting too much.
Combining Gorgonzola with pasta water can easily lead to a very creamy cover for the pasta, as can be achieved with other types of cheeses.&hellip;

						This post describes the application of a Probabilistic Graphical Model for simple image denoising, as suggested in Bishop&rsquo;s chapter 8.3.8. I will attempt to introduce some notions for general context without derivations. Googling will lead to plenty of useful resources. On an introductory level, I enjoyed Daphne Koller&rsquo;s class.
Context: Probabilistic Graphical Models Probabilistic Graphical Models are tools to model and express conditional independencies among a set of random variables.&hellip;

 A friend takes time to share something with me. I take pleasure in exploring music per se. Both conjuncted, there is a possibility to bond over music.  Hence there is a great amount of potential!
Yet, on the other hand, it&rsquo;s a bit of a mess.&hellip;

Circumventing these with a somewhat brute approach made it possible to get the extension to run more smoothly. Besides still being able to build it from source, it is now available in the chrome extension store.

						Scenario and goal You are the host of an event for which there are \(n\) candidates to be invited and you possess sufficient resources to host all candidates. Let the nature of the event be such that it seems personally attached to you, yet also fairly polarizing in its experience. In other words:
 some invitees will have a desire to decline invitees with a desire to decline will feel bad about declining some non-invitees will have a desire to attend non-invitees with a desire to attend will feel bad about not being able to attend  Moreover, one might weigh the ambitions wrt non-desiring invitees and desiring non-invitees differently.&hellip;

					<time>Jan 23, 2020</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						While mindlessly strolling around the leftover 18th century fortifications of a coastal Moroccan town I came across some streets with vendors of apparently local tableware. I found said tableware to be really beautiful. Sadly, the pure state of admiration only lasted briefly. The latter was soon accompanied and then progressively consumed by the concern of what to buy for whom. It got me quite excited (in a twisted way) and thinking hard about how my own tableware could be complemented, how others could use any tableware.&hellip;

						Most Machine Learning projects have seen me write a function to log data to a log-file as well as apply a logarithm to a vector. As I&rsquo;m not aware of a conventionally used synonym for the former use of &rsquo;log&rsquo; and the latter is usually referred to as &rsquo;log&rsquo; in mathematics (thereby rejecting the argument I would usually bring up in naming issues: avoid abbreviations and acronyms) a naming problem naturally arises.&hellip;

					<time>Dec 28, 2019</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						Capuns are dumplings wrapped in chard leaves stemming from the Swiss canton of Graubünden. While they traditionally rely on bacon, I gave sundried tomatoes and mushrooms a shot in the leading role. Umami has to come from somewhere. Moreover I added cheese to the filling and browned with cheese and cream in the oven. I believe both do not necessarily correspond to the default approach.
Ingredients Serves 4 hungry people.&hellip;

						As explained in a previous post, I log the distances of my runs. In the following I will make some simple observations based on this data. The data goes back to 2016 and comprises timestamps and running distances in km.
In bad storytelling manner let&rsquo;s start with the most graspable and interesting statistic first: average and overall distance across years. I had never computed those before and had basically no intuition on it at all.&hellip;
