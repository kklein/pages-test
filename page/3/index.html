While I&rsquo;ve often got there by covering it in honey and balsamic vinegar, I was inclined to look for a similar effect with actual grapes. In additional to the lovely interplay of bitterness and sweetness, there is something light about the acidity of the grapes.
I figured that caramelized onions would only enhance this interplay without distracting too much.
Combining Gorgonzola with pasta water can easily lead to a very creamy cover for the pasta, as can be achieved with other types of cheeses.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2020-05-10-chicory_gorgonzola/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2020-03-27-mrf/>Markov Random Field Image Denoising</a></h1><time>Apr 26, 2020</time><br><div class=description>This post describes the application of a Probabilistic Graphical Model for simple image denoising, as suggested in Bishop&rsquo;s chapter 8.3.8. I will attempt to introduce some notions for general context without derivations. Googling will lead to plenty of useful resources. On an introductory level, I enjoyed Daphne Koller&rsquo;s class.

some invitees will have a desire to decline invitees with a desire to decline will feel bad about declining some non-invitees will have a desire to attend non-invitees with a desire to attend will feel bad about not being able to attend Moreover, one might weigh the ambitions wrt non-desiring invitees and desiring non-invitees differently.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2020-03-02-invitations/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2020-01-23-tableware/>Not buying tableware</a></h1><time>Jan 23, 2020</time><br><div class=description>While mindlessly strolling around the leftover 18th century fortifications of a coastal Moroccan town I came across some streets with vendors of apparently local tableware. I found said tableware to be really beautiful. Sadly, the pure state of admiration only lasted briefly. The latter was soon accompanied and then progressively consumed by the concern of what to buy for whom. It got me quite excited (in a twisted way) and thinking hard about how my own tableware could be complemented, how others could use any tableware.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2020-01-23-tableware/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2020-01-16-log/>Log, right?</a></h1><time>Jan 16, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Most Machine Learning projects have seen me write a function to log data to a log-file as well as apply a logarithm to a vector.

While they traditionally rely on bacon, I gave sundried tomatoes and mushrooms a shot in the leading role. Umami has to come from somewhere.
