Let&rsquo;s explore a depth-first search approach in this post.
Idea Depth-first search or DFS implies (at least) two things:
a graph, or rather, a tree a search This bares the question: What&rsquo;s the tree and what are we searching for?
The tree A tree must consist of nodes and edges. We define the nodes to represent a &lsquo;state&rsquo; of the game.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2021-02-28-sudoku_dfs/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2021-01-17-expecations/>Expectations are Twofold</a></h1><time>Jan 17, 2021</time><br><div class=description>I caught myself making the mistake of thinking I wasn&rsquo;t holding expectations when in fact, I was.
When telling myself to not have a certain expectation against someone, I did usually make sure to control my behaviour towards them. If I anticipated that I shouldn&rsquo;t have the expectation of an event taking place, I made sure not to make the responsible person feel negatively about the non-event. I figured that not holding the expectation would mean that I may not act upset or angry towards them.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2021-01-17-expecations/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2021-01-13-caring/>I Could Care Less</a></h1><time>Jan 13, 2021</time><br><div class=description>While I think that I&rsquo;ve been doing okay when it comes to not caring too much about other people&rsquo;s perception of me, I believe to have spotted some weak spots recently.
I think there is still a distinction to be made when it comes to &lsquo;caring&rsquo;. I feel like there is a qualitative difference between caring about what exactly others think of me when in their presence and caring about an imagine I have of myself - hypothetically representing me towards others - but practically never witnessed by anyone.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2021-01-13-caring/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2021-01-02-2020_consuming/>2020 in Consuming</a></h1><time>Jan 2, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Just rambling about some books, podcasts and records I&rsquo;ve been exposed to a bunch over 2020.

There are two, frequently opposing, guiding principles at work:
Be who, how and what you want to be. The past tells you what works for you and what doesn&rsquo;t. The former being a fairly idealistic and empowering maxim, possibly reminiscent of rationalism, I like to think of the latter as Realpolitik on a personal level with a scent of empiricism.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2020-10-25-value-of-past/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2020-10-24-working-fast/>On Working Fast</a></h1><time>Oct 24, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Many discussions regarding software tooling had me facing the argument that while my suggestions might decrease the duration required for the task at hand to some degree, the magnitude or quantity of the savings were not sufficiently significant, that they would not amortize.

I&rsquo;ve often felt strongly about gifts made and received and always had some vague intuitions floating around in my head concerning distinctive properties. Finally have I sought to distill them and make them more explicit.
Reflecting on past gift-finding processes, I came to realize that I would often feel dissatisfied when most of the value of a gift would stem from money.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2020-08-03-gifts/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2020-07-25-fig_quiche/>Fig quiche</a></h1><time>Jul 25, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Ingredients 300g shortcrust dough large bunch of basil ~200g Soft, creamy goat cheese, e.g. Chavroux ~400g of figs (both fresh and dried are ok) 4-6 red onions 2 cloves of garlic zest of one lemon ~3 eggs ~80ml cream [0] some lemon juice some nutmeg some sweet paprika powder seasoning Method Slice the red onions in rings and fry them under medium-high heat with both olive oil and butter.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/pages-test/posts/2020-07-25-fig_quiche/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/pages-test/posts/2020-05-16-eggs/>Orange pink eggs</a></h1><time>Jun 6, 2020</time><br><div class=description>I have a feeling that hard-boiled eggs are conventially viewed as unsexy.
